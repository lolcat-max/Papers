The protein that produces dopamine is primarily the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. This enzyme converts the amino acid L-tyrosine into L-DOPA, which is then converted to dopamine by another enzyme called aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Tyrosine hydroxylase is thus the rate-limiting protein in dopamine synthesis.

Dopamine Synthesis Proteins
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH): Converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, the direct precursor of dopamine.

Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC or DOPA decarboxylase): Converts L-DOPA into dopamine.

Dopamine Biochemistry Overview
Dopamine is synthesized mainly in certain neurons and adrenal gland cells. It is made from the amino acid phenylalanine through a metabolic pathway involving tyrosine and L-DOPA. Dopamine itself is a neurotransmitter acting through various dopamine receptors in the brain and other tissues.​

Relevant Dopamine Receptors
Dopamine acts on five main receptor types, D1 to D5, which mediate its physiological effects but do not produce it. The actual dopamine production enzyme to focus on is tyrosine hydroxylase.​

In summary, the key protein responsible for producing dopamine is tyrosine hydroxylase, supported by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase for the final synthesis step.

Dopamine
Dopamine (DA, a contraction of 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neuromodulatory molecule that plays several important roles in cells. It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released...

Biochemistry, Dopamine Receptors - StatPearls
Cell-to-cell communication is critical for the survival of an organism. Cells can communicate through a process called the signal transduction pathway. When sending a signal, different molecules, such as hormones, can bind to a receptor on or inside the cell membrane, leading to chemical reactions in the cell, ultimately reaching the target. Cells use a second messenger to transmit these messages.

Dopamine receptor
The existence of multiple types of receptors for dopamine was first proposed in 1976. There are at least five subtypes of dopamine receptors, D~1~, D~2~, D~3~, D~4~, and D~5~. The D~1~ and D~5~ receptors are members of the D~1~-like family of dopamine receptors, whereas the D~2~, D~3~, and D~4~ receptors are members of the D~2~-like family. There is also some evidence that suggests the existence of possible D~6~ and D~7~ dopamine receptors, but such receptors have not been conclusively...
How to stimulate tyrosine hydroxylase

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, can be stimulated primarily through phosphorylation and regulation by various factors:

Key Mechanisms to Stimulate Tyrosine Hydroxylase
Phosphorylation: TH activity is increased by phosphorylation at several serine residues (Ser19, Ser31, Ser40). Phosphorylation at Ser40 by protein kinase A (PKA) is the major activating event, while Ser31 is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 kinases, and Ser19 by CaMKII, indirectly enhancing activity by promoting phosphorylation at the other sites.

Calcium influx: Electrical nerve stimulation or elevated intracellular calcium can promote TH activation, likely through kinases triggered by calcium signaling.

Nerve Growth Factor (NGF): NGF rapidly activates TH enzymatic activity, increasing dopamine synthesis in neurons.

Nicotine: Nicotine can sustain increased phosphorylation and activity of TH for up to 48 hours.

Gene transcription upregulation: Some stimuli like nicotine and prolonged sympathetic activation can increase TH gene expression, leading to more enzyme production.

Cofactors and iron: Proper availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and iron (Fe2+) in the TH active site are essential for activity.

Nutritional and Molecular Factors
Providing substrates like the amino acid tyrosine.

Maintaining healthy cellular redox balance as oxidative stress can affect TH activity.

Protein-protein interactions with enzymes and chaperones involved in dopamine synthesis regulation.

Summary
Stimulating tyrosine hydroxylase mainly involves enhancing its phosphorylation state through kinases activated by calcium signaling (e.g., PKA, CaMKII), nerve growth factors, and certain external substances like nicotine. These modifications relieve feedback inhibition and increase enzymatic activity, thereby boosting dopamine production.​

How to immobilize it

Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) can be immobilized on various supports to improve its stability and catalytic efficiency, with recent work exploring immobilization on nanomaterials.

Methods to Immobilize Tyrosine Hydroxylase
Chemical coupling to nanoparticles: TH has been immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles using various surface linkers, enhancing enzyme stability and enabling reuse.​

Immobilization on ZnO nanocrystals: Immobilizing TH from Aspergillus oryzae on ZnO nanoparticles resulted in an over 11-fold increase in enzyme activity and stability.​

Attachment to water-insoluble carriers: This is a common method for enzyme immobilization that improves enzyme stability and allows reuse in continuous processes.​

Immobilization on Nanocellulose
Nanocellulose, especially bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), is widely used as a biocompatible, high-surface-area support for enzyme immobilization via physical adsorption or covalent bonding.

Enzymes immobilized on BNC retain activity and show improved stability and reusability, seen in studies with laccase and lactonase enzymes.​

Covalent immobilization approaches using chemical linkers like glutaraldehyde or coordination bonds with metal ions are promising strategies to attach enzymes to nanocellulose.​

The physical properties of the nanocellulose (fiber density, pore size) influence enzyme loading and retention.​

Summary of Immobilization Steps for TH on Nanocellulose
Prepare nanocellulose support: Use bacterial or plant-derived nanocellulose with appropriate surface properties for enzyme binding.

Functionalize nanocellulose: Oxidize or chemically modify nanocellulose to introduce reactive groups (e.g., aldehydes) for covalent attachment.

Enzyme coupling: Attach TH via covalent bonds (e.g., with glutaraldehyde) or coordinate binding to metal ions on the nanocellulose surface.

Optimize conditions: Adjust pH, temperature, and enzyme loading to maximize activity and stability.

Characterize immobilized enzyme: Test enzymatic activity retention, stability over time, and potential reuse cycles.

This approach promises enhanced TH stability and efficiency useful for biosynthesis or sensor applications. While specific TH immobilization on nanocellulose is not extensively reported yet, parallels with other enzymes suggest it is a viable and promising method.​
