In a typical in-vitro (test tube) experiment, scientists use a specific protein as a substrate to test the effectiveness of serrapeptase.

Preparation: Purified serrapeptase is added to a solution containing a protein substrate. A common protein used for this purpose is casein, the main protein found in milk, which is often a component of protein powders. Another substrate, azocasein, is also used because its breakdown can be easily measured with a spectrophotometer.

Enzymatic Reaction: As soon as it is introduced, the serrapeptase enzymes begin to break the peptide bonds of the protein substrate. This process, called proteolysis or hydrolysis, breaks the large protein molecules into smaller peptides and amino acids.

Measurement of Activity: Scientists measure the rate at which the protein is broken down. This "proteolytic activity" is often quantified in enzymatic units and is influenced by factors like temperature and pH. Studies show that serrapeptase functions optimally at physiological conditions, around 37°C (98.6°F) and a neutral pH, similar to the environment in the human body.

Outcome: The result of this lab experiment is the degradation of the protein. The protein powder effectively serves as "food" for the enzyme.



When serrapeptase is combined with a regular protein powder in a lab setting, it acts as a catalyst to break down the protein into its fundamental building blocks: amino acids. The specific amino acids that are generated depend entirely on the composition of the protein powder itself. Serrapeptase doesn't create new amino acids; it simply liberates the ones that are already there, linked together in long chains.

Since many common protein powders are derived from milk protein, a primary component is casein. Casein is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that the human body cannot produce on its own.

Therefore, when serrapeptase digests a casein-based protein powder, it would release the full spectrum of amino acids that make up casein, including :

Essential Amino Acids (EAAs)
Histidine

Isoleucine

Leucine

Lysine

Methionine

Phenylalanine

Threonine

Tryptophan

Valine

Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAAs)
Alanine

Asparagine

Aspartic Acid

Glutamic Acid

Conditionally Essential Amino Acids
Arginine

Cysteine

Glutamine

Glycine

Proline

Serine

Tyrosine

Lab studies analyzing the breakdown of casein show that some amino acids are released in higher quantities because they are more abundant in the protein's structure. For casein, the most predominant amino acids released are typically glutamic acid/glutamine, proline, and leucine.

In essence, the outcome of mixing serrapeptase with protein powder is the creation of a "pre-digested" liquid protein, where the large, complex protein molecules have been hydrolyzed into their individual amino acid components.
